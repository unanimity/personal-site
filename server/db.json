      "description": "Two Russian satellites are planned to be activated inside the International Space Station (ISS) Russian Segment as part of a verification test from July 4-8.\n\nThe satellites will eventually be deployed by hand from the ISS during a Russian space walk tentatively scheduled for August 17, 2017.\n\nThe satellites Tanusha 1 and Tanusha 2 [спутники Тануша 1/2] FM transmissions on 437.050 MHz, will be downlinked at 145.800 MHz FM. Transmissions from Tanusha 1 should begin around 18:30 UT on July 4. Transmissions will cease on July 6 from 08:20 till 18:00 UT to allow the satellites to be swapped out. Tanusha 2 will then be activated beginning on July 6 around 18:00 UT and continue until July 8 at 10:30 UT.\nThe satellites will broadcast greeting messages in Russian, English, Spanish and Chinese. More details will be made available on the Southwest Western State University site at https://www.swsu.ru/",
